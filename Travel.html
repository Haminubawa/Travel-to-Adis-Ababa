        <h1>Adis Ababa</h1>
        <p>Addis Ababa, Ethiopia's capital, is a vibrant and historical city often called the "Capital of Africa" because 
            it hosts the headquarters of the African Union and many international organizations. Nestled at an altitude of 
            around 2,355 meters (7,726 feet), it’s one of the highest capital cities in the world, which gives it a mild,
            temperate climate all year round.

            The city is a fascinating blend of old and new: modern skyscrapers and bustling markets sit alongside ancient 
            churches and cultural landmarks. Highlights include the National Museum of Ethiopia, where the famous 
            3.2-million-year-old fossil, Lucy, is displayed, and Merkato Market, the largest open-air market in Africa. 
            Addis Ababa is also famous for its coffee culture. Ethiopia is the birthplace of coffee, and in Addis, you
            can experience traditional Ethiopian coffee ceremonies—a ritual that’s both social and deeply cherished.

            Addis   Ababa offers a gateway to Ethiopian history, culture, and traditions, making it a must-visit destination 
            for anyone interested in Africa’s rich heritage.
